To learn how to use Sokrates, like with any software tools or programming languages, you need to do some hands-on work. [Install Sokrates](install), and use this to analyze your code. For instance, Figure 1 illustrates how to create an initial analysis. This analysis will generate an initial configuration file under **_sokrates/config.json**, and reports under the **_sokrates/reports/html** folder. Explore these artifacts to get a basic familiarity with Sokrates projects.

{% highlight sh %}
    git clone https://github.com/junit-team/junit5
    cd junit5
    java -jar sokrates-LATEST.jar extractGitHistory

    java -jar sokrates-LATEST.jar init
    java -jar sokrates-LATEST.jar generateReports

    open _sokrates/reports/html/index.html
{% endhighlight %}

The [Sokrates website](https://www.sokrates.dev/) provides a gallery with the results of analyses of 66 open-source projects in 24 programming languages. Each project includes both the results of Sokrates analyses as well as a configuration file used to configure the analysis.
